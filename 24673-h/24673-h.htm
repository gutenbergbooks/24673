<h2>THE REG'LAR LARK</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
The Reg'lar Lark's a very gay old Bird;<br />
At sunrise often may his voice be heard<br />
As jauntily he wends his homeward way,<br />
And trills a fresh and merry roundelay.<br />
And some old, wise philosopher has said:<br />
Rise with a lark, and with a lark to bed.<br />

<h2><br />THE HUMBUG</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
Although a learned Entomologist<br />
May doubt if Humbugs really do exist,<br />
Yet each of us, I'm sure, can truly say<br />
We've seen a number of them in our day.<br />
But are they real?&mdash;well, a mind judicial<br />
Perhaps would call them false and artificial.<br />

<h2>THE POPPYCOCK</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
The Poppycock's a fowl of English breed,<br />
And therefore many think him fine indeed.<br />
Credulous people's ears he would regale,<br />
And so he crows aloud and spreads his tale.<br />
But he is stuffed with vain and worthless words;<br />
Fine feathers do not always make fine birds.<br />

<h2>THE HAYCOCK</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
The Haycock cannot crow; he has no brains,<br />
No,&mdash;not enough to go in when it rains.<br />
He is not gamy,&mdash;fighting's not his forte,<br />
A Haycock fight is just no sort of sport.<br />
Down in the meadow all day long he'll bide,<br />
(That is a little hay-hen by his side.)<br />

A Theory, by scientists defended,<br />
Declares that we from monkeys are descended.<br />

The Powder-Monkey heads some pedigree.<br />
Ah, yes,&mdash;from him descend by evolution,<br />
The Dames and Daughters of the Revolution.<br />

<h2>THE TREE CALF</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
The sportive Tree Calf here we see,<br />
He builds his nest up in a tree;<br />
To this strange dwelling-place he cleaves<br />
Because he is so fond of leaves.<br />
'Twas his ancestral cow, I trow,<br />
Jumped o'er the moon, so long ago.<br />
But he is not so great a rover,<br />
Though at the last he runs to cover.<br />

The Military Frog, as well you know,<br />
Is the famed one who would a-wooing go.<br />
And on the soldier's manly breast displayed,<br />
He wins the heart of every blushing maid.<br />
But, as a frog, I think he's incomplete,<br />
He has no good hind legs that we may eat.<br />

This animal of which I speak<br />
Is a most curious sort of freak.<br />
Though Serpent would its form describe,<br />
Yet it is of the feathered tribe.<br />

That tempted poor old Mother Eve,<br />
For never woman did exist<br />
Who could its subtle charm resist.<br />

Oft through the stillness of the summer night<br />
We see the Brick Bat take his rapid flight.<br />
And, with unerring aim, descending straight,<br />
He meets a cat on the back garden gate.<br />
The little Brick Bat could not fly alone,&mdash;<br />
Oh, no; there is a power behind the thrown.<br />

The Cat O' Nine Tails is not very nice,&mdash;<br />
No good at all at catching rats and mice;<br />
She eats no fish, though living on the sea,<br />
And no one's friend or pet she seems to be.<br />
Yet oft she makes it lively for poor Jack,&mdash;<br />
Curls round his legs, and jumps upon his back.<br />

You scarce can see his head or tail at all.<br />

The Iron Spider is an insect strange,<br />
He loves to stand upon a red-hot range.<br />

'Twould not have filled the maiden with such awe.<br />

The early reed-bird catches the bookworm?<br />

The Black Sheep is a beast all men should shun&mdash;<br />
He has no fleece yet fleeces every one;<br />
Though without horns, oft with a horn he's seen;<br />
Though not a lamb, he gambles on the green.<br />
Perhaps he's not a sheep, as some suggest,<br />
But a grim wolf who's in sheep's clothing dressed.<br />

Is when it's aimed at some stray neighboring Cat.<br />

Of the historic novel of to-day.<br />

<h2>THE SAW-BUCK</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
The Saw-Buck is a fearsome beast.<br />
The tramp objects to it, at least.<br />
When to the housewife he applies<br />
For coffee or for apple-pies,<br />
Right speedily he'll turn and leave her<br />
When he is seized with Saw-Buck Fever.<br />

<h2>THE PIGEON TOAD</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
The Pigeon Toad's a funny little beast,<br />
He's found in every land from West to East.<br />
The children bring him in, to our amaze,<br />
And though we try to turn him out, he stays.<br />
He's never seen with soldiers, nor with fops,<br />
But with the schoolboys how he jumps and hops.<br />

<h2>THE GOLDEN BUCK</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
Perhaps because it's easily approached,<br />
The Golden Buck's a game that's often poached.<br />
'Tis sometimes mild, again 'tis strong and hearty,<br />
It may be found at many a gay stag-party.<br />
No branching antlers this strange beast adorn,<br />
But with the Golden Buck we take a horn.<br />

<h2>THE BUMBLE PUPPY</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
This is the Bumblepuppy. He's quite tame,<br />
Although he's said to be a sort of game.<br />
You scorn him, yet you must&mdash;ah, there's the rub&mdash;<br />
Accept him at your table or your club.<br />
He has his points, yet he's a pest, indeed;<br />
I would we could exterminate the breed.<br />

<h2>THE WATCH DOG</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
This useful animal we keep<br />
To guard our treasure while we sleep.<br />
A pointer, not a setter, yet<br />
He's of no use unless he's set.<br />
Gaze on his open, honest face,&mdash;<br />
There's no deception in his case.<br />
He is attached to us, 'tis plain,<br />
Though often by a slender chain.<br />

<h2>THE GOLD EAGLE</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
Here's the Gold Eagle. Very rare. They say<br />
This bird is worth ten dollars any day.<br />
He has no wings, apparently, yet I<br />
Or you, or anyone can make him fly.<br />
He's very powerful&mdash;held in great esteem;<br />
And money talks, so let the eagle scream.<br />

<h2>THE BUGBEAR</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
Of all the fearsome beasts beneath the sun<br />
The Bugbear is the most appalling one.<br />
At night he comes and hovers o'er our bed,<br />
Filling us with a nameless fear and dread.<br />
He is not half so terrible by day&mdash;<br />
Sometimes he shrinks and dwindles quite away.<br />

<h2>THE IRISH BULL</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
Among the stock jokes it is oft averred<br />
The Irish Bull is best of all the heard.<br />
He has no points, he has no head or tail,<br />
But many a jovial party he'll regale.<br />
And all his hearers will with laughter choke,<br />
Except his brother John, who sees no joke.<br />

<h2>THE JAY</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
'Tis very strange, and yet, upon my word,<br />
This silly fellow thinks he is a bird!<br />
He lives on hayseed,&mdash;everywhere he's found,<br />
But in the country he does most abound.<br />
And at the approach of winter, (more's the pity),<br />
A flock of jays will migrate to the city.<br />

<h2>FOREBEARS</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
Misled by certain signs of form and shape,<br />
Some think we are descended from the ape.<br />
But recent science now the truth declares<br />
The human race descended from Forebears.<br />
And since we're so inclined to war, I'll wager<br />
One of our Forebears was the Ursa Major.<br />

<h2>THE HIGH HORSE</h2>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
The High Horse often takes a foremost place<br />
Among the winners of the human race.<br />
They say one needs both brawn and brain to ride him,<br />
And even then 'tis very hard to guide him.<br />
His jockeys gaily prance and boldly scoff,<br />
But soon or late they're sure to tumble off.<br />
